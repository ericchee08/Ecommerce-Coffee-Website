# P6 Ecommerce Coffee Website
 
 My coffee website website I designed using CSS, HTML and Javascript. 
 
## Why did I make an e-commerce coffee website?

The idea came about from a work colleague who was really into fresh coffee, he had great knowledge in the subject and was the person who introduced me into drinking and making coffee with fresh beans. At this point I was more and more intrigued with the idea and began to add it to my daily lifestyle. 

Therefore, to learn more about it, I decided to develop a website which required me to go out and research about different products and the methods of coffee making. Not only has this project improved my web development skills, it has also developed my taste in quality coffee. :)
